## Feature-Based Architecture

### Import Restrictions

**Do not import deeply from features**. Only import from the feature root or its top-level files.

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Import from feature root
import { Resource, getResourceMetadata } from "@/features/resources";
import { AbstractResourceForm } from "@/features/abstract-resource-form";

// ✅ Good - Import from feature entry point files
import { getAuthStateServer } from "@/features/authentication/server";
import { getResourceMetadata } from "@/features/resources/node";

// ❌ Bad - Deep imports into feature internals
import type { ResourceMetadata } from "@/features/resources/types/metadata";
import { FormInputs } from "@/features/abstract-resource-form/components/inputs";
```

Features are free to define internal types, utilities and structures, and will only re-export the code they consider "public-facing", that is suitable to be imported from outside of the feature, in one of the feature top-level files.

On the other hand, the code within a specific feature should always use _relative imports_ when importing code inside of that same feature. This is to visually separate the local code in the imports list, as well as to reduce unnecessary usage of the barrel files.

### Feature Entry Points

Each feature must have clear entry points:

- **`index.ts`**: Client-side exports (React Client Components, hooks, utilities)
- **`server.ts`**: Server-side exports (React Server Components, server actions)
- **`node.ts`**: Node.js environment exports (for tests, scripts, build tools)

```typescript
// features/authentication/index.ts
export { LoginPage } from "./components/login-page";
export { useAuth } from "./hooks/use-auth";

// features/authentication/server.ts
export { getAuthStateServer } from "./utils/get-auth-state-server";
export { PrivateLayout } from "./components/private-layout";

// features/authentication/node.ts
export { AUTH_STATE_COOKIE_NAME } from "./constants";
export { parseAuthCookie } from "./utils/parse-auth-cookie";
```

Exporting strategy: when creating a new feature, start with re-exporting the files needed outside of it inside of `index.ts` using it as a barrel file. Next.js does not produce errors with files exported in this manner because it uses Turbopack, which performs tree-shaking and does not actually execute each import when importing from a barrel file. On the other hand, test environments such as Vitest or Playwright do not use bundlers, so when encountering a barrel file like `index.ts` they will import all re-exported code. Sometimes you will re-export files that are only supposed to be used in specific environments, such as [server-only code](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components#keeping-server-only-code-out-of-the-client-environment), and hence they will fail to load in these environments. In this case, you will need to define separate barrel files for the different environments.

The most common points of issue are:

- `next/image` - This component is mocked in vitest, but Playwright cannot resolve Next.js's `<Image>` component when running spec files. Ensure you are not importing from a barrel file which exposes a component that directly or indirectly uses `next/image`.
- `server-only` - Files or components marked as server-only will fail to be imported in both Vitest and Playwright. If a test file imports from a feature exposing server-only code, it's best to separate the non-React files in a barrel called `node.ts` which will then be used by test files.

### Feature Structure

Each feature is a self-contained module with its own components, types, and utilities. The specific directory layout is listed in [FILE_STRUCTURE.md](FILE_STRUCTURE.md#features-directory-srcfeatures).

> [!Note]
> Features need not include all of these files and directories, but only those which will actually be used.

### Public API Surface

**Features expose a public API** through their entry point files. Internal implementation details should not be imported directly.

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Use public API
import { Resource, getResourceMetadata } from "@/features/resources";
// ❌ Bad - Import internal implementation
import { RESOURCE_METADATA } from "@/features/resources/data/resource-metadata";
```

### Cross-Feature Dependencies

Features can depend on each other, but should do so through public APIs:

```typescript
// ✅ Good
import { Bouncer } from "@/features/authentication/server";

// ❌ Bad
import { Bouncer } from "@/features/authentication/components/bouncer";
```

## Component Organization

### Component Categories

Components are organized by their role and reusability:

1. **`core/`**: Generic, highly reusable components (buttons, links, spinners)
2. **`inputs/`**: Form input components (text, checkbox, date, file uploads)
3. **`presentation/`**: Display/presentational components specific to the ToPWR Admin Panel (navbar, error messages, logos)
4. **`ui/`**: Third-party UI library components (shadcn/ui)
5. **`providers/`**: Global context and API providers meant to wrap the entire application

### Component File Structure

For simple components:

```txt
component-name.tsx
component-name.test.tsx
```

For complex components with multiple files:

```txt
component-name/
  index.tsx                 # Main component export or shared code
  client.tsx                # Component variant for client-side use
  server.tsx                # Component variant for server-side use
  component-name.test.tsx   # Component unit tests
```

### Component Prop Types

Define prop types inline if they are only used once. Separate them into a type or interface only if used elsewhere.

TODO: remove the `@/types/components.ts` file in favour of localizing component prop interfaces.

---

## Type Definitions

### Type Organization

- **Shared types**: `src/types/` (components.ts, helpers.ts, schemas.ts)
- **Feature types**: `src/features/<feature>/types/`

### Type Exports

Export types from feature public APIs:

```typescript
// features/resources/index.ts
export type { Resource } from "./enums";
export type { ResourceMetadata, ResourceFormValues } from "./types";
```

---

## Route Structure

### Layout Hierarchy

```txt
app/layout.tsx                              # Root layout
  ├─ (private)/layout.tsx                   # Private layout (auth required)
  │   └─ (resources)/<resource>/layout.tsx  # Resource layout
  └─ (public)/layout.tsx                    # Public layout (no auth)
```

### Route Permissions

Routes are protected using the `Bouncer` component:

```typescript
export default async function PrivateLayout({ children }: WrapperProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Navbar />
      <MainContent>
        <Bouncer route="/">{children}</Bouncer>
      </MainContent>
    </>
  );
}
```

Make sure to wrap any protected content using `Bouncer` as it ensures the currently logged in user has the appropriate permissions before rendering its children.

---

## Environment Variables

### Validation

Environment variables are validated using Zod in `src/config/env.ts`:

```typescript
const envSchema = z.object({
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: z.string().url(),
  NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV: z.enum(["development", "staging", "production"]),
  // ...
});

export const env = envSchema.parse(process.env);
```

### Usage

Import validated env variables:

```typescript
import { env } from "@/config/env";

const apiUrl = env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

> [!Caution]
> Do not use `process.env` for accessing environment variables directly as they are neither typed nor ensured to be present by the configuration.

### Naming Convention

- **Public variables**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (accessible in browser)
- **Server-only variables**: No prefix (only accessible server-side)

---

## Constants Organization

### Location

- **App-wide constants**: `src/config/constants.ts`
- **Feature-specific constants**: `src/features/<feature>/constants.ts`

---

## Schema Conventions

### Zod Schemas

- **Shared schemas**: `src/schemas/`
- **Resource schemas**: `src/features/resources/schemas/`
- **Feature schemas**: `src/features/<feature>/schemas/`

### Schema Naming

Schemas use PascalCase with "Schema" suffix:

```typescript
export const RequiredStringSchema = z.string().trim().min(1);
export const ColorValueSchema = z.string().regex(/^#([0-9a-fA-F]{3}){1,2}$/);
export const IsoTimestampSchema = z.string().datetime({ offset: true });
```

### Schema Exports

Export from feature public APIs:

```typescript
// features/resources/index.ts
export { BannerSchema, GuideArticleSchema } from "./schemas";
```

---

## Data vs Utils

### `src/data/`

Static data and constants:

- Error messages
- Configuration objects
- Predefined options/choices

### `src/utils/`

Pure utility functions:

- Data transformations
- Validation helpers
- Type guards
- Formatting functions

```typescript
// data/form-error-messages.ts - Static data
export const FORM_ERROR_MESSAGES = { ... };

// utils/is-empty-value.ts - Pure function
export const isEmptyValue = (value: unknown): boolean => { ... };
```
